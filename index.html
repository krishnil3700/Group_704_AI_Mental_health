<h1>AI’s role in mental health for the youth</h1>


</ul><p>As AI becomes more and more powerful, it is utilized in various ways. One of them is tackling mental health problems such as therapy and can help validate CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy) as treatment. In our assignment, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of AI’s role in therapeutic practices such as talking to an AI about problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as potential gaps and improvements. Especially in New Zealand where it is a rising issue, considerably in youth. New Zealand has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the OCED. We decided to choose this topic as we all know someone close to us who has suffered extreme mental health problems.  </p>
