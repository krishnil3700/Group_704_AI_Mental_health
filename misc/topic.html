<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


</ul><p>The impact of AI on young people's mental health has broad societal repercussions. The fact that it enables early identification and intervention is one important effect. We can spot early indicators of mental health problems in young individuals by using AI technology. This increases the likelihood of successful treatment and the ability to avert more serious issues by allowing them to get the assistance they require before their illnesses deteriorate. </p>

<p>The accessibility and expandability of mental health support is a further significant implication. Chatbots and virtual assistants that use AI can reach a bigger audience and help all the time. This aids in removing obstacles like scarce resources, protracted wait times, and stigma that frequently discourage young people from seeking assistance. AI may be able to reach and help more young people who would otherwise be unable to obtain mental health support. </p>
